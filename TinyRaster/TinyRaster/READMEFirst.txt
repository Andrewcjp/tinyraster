TinyRaster contains the skeleton of a 2D software rasteriser.
This project serves as the base framework of your Assignment 1 and certain tutorial exercises.

Please Note: 
The only source code you need to work on in order to complete the assignment exercises can be found in "Rasterizer.h and Rasterizer.cpp".
You can find which methods require completion by reading the TODO comments in "Rasterizer.cpp".

The other source files in project contain classes that support the vector calculations and the test application. 
You DO NOT need to deal with them for the purpose of completing the assignment exercises.

Example solution:
The executable of an example solution can be found in the directory "ExampleSolution"

Test Cases:
There are a total of 8 test cases provided. You can switch them by pressing F1 - F8.
